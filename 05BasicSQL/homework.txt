All exercises here concern the music database, which is available at http://tahaghoghi.com/LearningMySQL/Downloads/Files/Data/SQL_files_with_foreign_key_references/music.sql

I strongly recommend theta join style as per http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/mysql-joins-on-vs-using-vs-theta-style - the nutshell is that ANSI style is like this:

SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 WHERE field1=field2 AND filter=something;

Theta style is like this:
SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON (field1=field2) WHERE filter=something;

The reason for this is that when you have many tables joined it's easier to see the join clause in ON or USING with theta style. 
If you join many tables and use ANSI style, where everything is in the WHERE clause, it's possible to forget some of the join clauses 
in the WHERE. If you put the join clauses in the JOIN part, it's way more readable.

1) Use one or more SELECT statements to find out how many tracks are on New Order's Brotherhood album.

SELECT count(*) FROM track 
	INNER JOIN album ON (track.album_id=album.album_id)
	INNER JOIN artist ON (artist.artist_id=track.artist_id) 
	WHERE 
	artist_name="New Order";
	AND 
	album_name="Brotherhood" 

2) Using a join, list the albums that we own by the band New Order

SELECT album_name FROM album 
	INNER JOIN artist ON (album.artist_id=artist.artist_id) 
	WHERE 
	artist.artist_name="New Order";

3) With INSERT statements, add the artist Leftfield to the database. For this new artist, add the album "Leftism" that has
the following tracks:
a. Release the Pressure (Time: 7.39)
b. Afro-Melt (Time: 7.33)
c. Melt (Time: 5.21)
d. Song of Life (Time: 6.55)
e. Original (Time: 6.00)
f. Black Flute (Time: 3.46)
g. Space Shanty (Time: 7.15)
h. Inspection Check One (Time: 6.30)
i. Storm 3000 (Time: 5.44)
j. Open Up (Time: 6.52)
k. 21st Century Poem (Time: 5.42)
l. Bonus Track (Time: 1.22)

The answer to this question should be the INSERT statement(s).
INSERT INTO artist (artist_id,artist_name) VALUES (7,"Leftfield");
INSERT INTO album (artist_id,album_id,album_name) VALUES (7,8,"Leftism");
INSERT INTO track (artist_id,album_id,track_id,track_name,time) 
VALUES
(7,8,1,"Release the Pressure",7.39),
(7,8,2,"Afro-Melt",7.33),
(7,8,3,"Melt",5.21),
(7,8,4,"Song of Life",6.55),
(7,8,5,"Original",6.00),
(7,8,6,"Black Flute",3.46),
(7,8,7,"Space Shanty",7.15),
(7,8,8,"Inspection Check One",6.30),
(7,8,9,"Storm 3000",5.44),
(7,8,10,"Open Up",6.52),
(7,8,11,"21st Century Poem",5.42),
(7,8,12,"Bonus Track",1.22);


4) How long in minutes is the Leftism album you added in Question 3? Hint: use the
SUM() aggregate function.
SELECT SUM(time) FROM track WHERE album_id=8;
+-----------+
| sum(time) |
+-----------+
|     67.99 |
+-----------+


5) Change the time for the Original track on the Leftism album to 6.22.
UPDATE track SET time=6.22 WHERE album_id=8 AND track_name="Original";
